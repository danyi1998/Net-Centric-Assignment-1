Both the network simulator and sliding window environment components were supplied and implemented by the professors. 

My partner and I implemented the sliding window protocol using the selective repeat retransmission strategy. Our code is found in SWP.java

Our implementation satisfies the requirements listed:
1) Full duplex data communication
2) In order delivery of packets to the network layer
3) Selective repeat retransmission strategy
4) Negative acknowledgement
5) Separate acknowledgement when the reverse traffic is light or none

Assignment 1 report explains our work, including key concepts.
